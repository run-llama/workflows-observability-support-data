Subject: Request for Detailed Pricing, Licensing, and Integration Scope for Enterprise Evaluation

Dear Sales Team,

I’m reaching out on behalf of Northwave Ventures, where we’re currently evaluating Your Best Software (YBS) for deployment across our analytics, data governance, and workflow orchestration teams.

To move forward with our internal review, we would appreciate your help clarifying the following items:

1. Detailed breakdown of enterprise pricing tiers — including any differences between per-seat, per-instance, and usage-based licensing models.
2. Clarification on what’s included in the “Advanced Automation Suite” mentioned on your Solutions page. Specifically, we’re interested in whether multi-layered rule chaining, conditional triggers, and external API actions are covered under standard pricing.
3. Guidance on available onboarding packages and professional services — such as deployment acceleration, custom workflow migration, and integration advisory.
4. List of integrations currently supported out-of-the-box, especially those relevant to our stack (e.g., Databricks, Snowflake, Azure Data Factory, and ServiceNow).
5. Confirmation on whether your current SLA guarantees uptime at or above 99.9%, and whether support tiers (Standard vs. Premier) differ in responsiveness for critical escalations.

We are aiming to finalize our shortlist by the end of next week, so a prompt response would be greatly appreciated. We’re especially interested in any pricing flexibility for teams over 100 users and scenarios with hybrid cloud/on-prem deployments.

Thank you in advance for your assistance, and I look forward to your reply.

Best regards,
